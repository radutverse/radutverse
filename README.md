# RadutVerse

A production-ready web platform for managing, visualizing, and monetizing tokenized intellectual property (IP), built for the blockchain era and powered by the Story Protocol SDK.

## Overview

RadutVerse is an all-in-one portal for IP ownership and monetization.
It lets users register their creations as on-chain IP, connect a wallet, explore portfolios, and trade IP-backed NFTs — all from one clean interface.
The platform integrates Story Protocol, OpenAI, and Pinata IPFS to make IP management smarter and more transparent.

docs/     → README, deployment, and architecture
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v18 or higher
* pnpm v10.14 or higher
* Git and Vercel account
* Story Protocol account and API access

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/radutverse.git
cd radutverse
pnpm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_PUBLIC_STORY_RPC=https://aeneid.storyrpc.io
STORY_API_KEY=your_story_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt
PINATA_GATEWAY=https://gateway.pinata.cloud
VITE_GUEST_PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_key
```

Then start development:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs both frontend and backend with hot reload on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy using:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
4. Your app will be live after the build completes

For Netlify or Docker, see `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for details.

## API Endpoints

**Check IP Assets**

```
POST /api/check-ip-assets
{ "address": "0x123..." }
```

**Analyze Image**

```
POST /api/analyze-image-vision
# multipart form with image + wallet address
```

**Capture Asset Vision**

```
POST /api/capture-asset-vision
{ "description": "...", "address": "0x..." }
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                 | Solution                              |                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Module not found      | Run `pnpm install`                    |                |
| Missing API key       | Check `.env.local` or Vercel settings |                |
| Wallet not connecting | Ensure EVM address is valid           |                |
| Port already in use   | Run `lsof -ti:5173                    | xargs kill -9` |

## Security

* Never commit `.env` files
* Validate all inputs with Zod and server checks
* Keep API keys on the backend only
* Verify wallet addresses before any transaction
* Use trusted origins for CORS
